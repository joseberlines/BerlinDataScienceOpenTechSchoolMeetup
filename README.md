We are a friendly group of data enthusiasts who are going to meet every other Thursday to learn together.

We start with our introductory round at 7:30, so please be there before.

"Data science" might be broadly defined as the collection and analysis of data, as well as the communication of any resulting insights. To this end, data scientists use a broad range of tools and methods: R, Python, databases, statistics, machine learning… The list goes on. No topic is off limits in our group, and every skill level is welcome, so come and learn from others, and share your own experience!

This is a Co-Learning group, so no presentations or lessons are planned, but we might occasionally put something together if there's enough interest.

The rules: Bring your own laptop and respect the code of conduct → http://www.opentechschool.org/code-of-conduct/.

If you don't have a project to work on, or if you're otherwise unsure how to get started, check out our list of tutorials and resources and our list of learning projects:
